## React Features
  - JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.
  - Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.
  - Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.
  - License − React is licensed under the Facebook Inc. Documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0.
